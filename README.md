# RugPG
Multi User Dungeon for the RuG, because every university needs one.

This product will work with the Telegram API to provide a Telegram bot that hosts a text based 
multiplayer dungeon crawler. Not only did we think this would be a very cool project, we also 
believe that every university should have one of these games. So have fun playing this game, and 
maybe even more importantly, help developing it.

## Compiling & running.
For compiling we use Maven, so that should be easy enough for everyone. Running however, requires
Maven as well (for now), as the program requires the API token to be passed as an argument upon
launch.
